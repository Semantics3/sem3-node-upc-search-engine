#Node UPC Search Engine

This is a demo pedagogical UPC search engine powered by the Semantics3 Product API.
It's built using Express, Jade and the Semantics3 Node npm library.
This app is based on the screencast, where it was built in a step by step manner.

## Installation

To install:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Semantics3/sem3-node-upc-search-engine.git
$ cd sem3-node-upc-search-engine
$ npm install
```

Insert in your credentials and insert in your API Key and API secret by editing credentials.json

To run:

```
$ node index.js
$ curl localhost:3019
```

## Requirements

* Express
* Jade
* Body-Parser
* Semantics3-Node

## Exploring Further

This is a simple application meant to demonstrate how to build a useful real world app based on the 
Semantics3 API. You can try extending this by adding features, such as in-app checkouts,
shopping price comparison or even allowing users to save their UPC queries and subscribing for price alerts.

Do keep us posted at support@semantics3.com if you build anything interesting!
